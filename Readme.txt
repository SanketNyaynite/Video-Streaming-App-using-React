# Questionaires
1. How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
=>I have developed this code using React Components as mentioned in the problem statement. Along with this have used couple of libraries such as react-native, react-bootstrap to make the code efficient.

2. Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
=> I would have liked to include a search bar option for the user so that they can search their interest.

3. What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
=>I would have added sorting option for the client. Also I would have created a login page.
